description: William Dean Howells spent scarcely a year in the classroom, but his
  father's newspaper offices afforded an invaluable education. In this charming memoir,
  Howells recalls, I could set type very well, and at ten years and onward till journalism
  became my university, the printing office was mainly my school."
